Item Response Theory posits a latent variable $\theta$ which describes the probability of a person getting an item "correct". The *item response function* is an increasing function of $\theta$.

Dichotomous models have two categories: correct/incorrect or yes/no.

Polytomous models have more than two, usually ordered categories. (E.g., Likert Scale and partial credit).

Test response function is a function of the item response functions.

Local independence assumption. Responses $X_j$ an $X_j'$ are conditionally independent given $\theta$.
